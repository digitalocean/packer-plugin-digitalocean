- `api_url` (string) - Non standard api endpoint URL. Set this if you are
  using a DigitalOcean API compatible service. It can also be specified via
  environment variable DIGITALOCEAN_API_URL.

- `http_retry_max` (\*int) - The maximum number of retries for requests that fail with a 429 or 500-level error.
  The default value is 5. Set to 0 to disable reties.

- `http_retry_wait_max` (\*float64) - The maximum wait time (in seconds) between failed API requests. Default: 30.0

- `http_retry_wait_min` (\*float64) - The minimum wait time (in seconds) between failed API requests. Default: 1.0

- `private_networking` (bool) - Set to true to enable private networking
  for the droplet being created. This defaults to false, or not enabled.

- `monitoring` (bool) - Set to true to enable monitoring for the droplet
  being created. This defaults to false, or not enabled.

- `droplet_agent` (\*bool) - A boolean indicating whether to install the DigitalOcean agent used for
  providing access to the Droplet web console in the control panel. By
  default, the agent is installed on new Droplets but installation errors
  (i.e. OS not supported) are ignored. To prevent it from being installed,
  set to false. To make installation errors fatal, explicitly set it to true.

- `ipv6` (bool) - Set to true to enable ipv6 for the droplet being
  created. This defaults to false, or not enabled.

- `snapshot_name` (string) - The name of the resulting snapshot that will
  appear in your account. Defaults to `packer-{{timestamp}}` (see
  configuration templates for more info).

- `snapshot_regions` ([]string) - Additional regions that resulting snapshot should be distributed to.

- `wait_snapshot_transfer` (\*bool) - When true, Packer will block until all snapshot transfers have been completed
  and report errors. When false, Packer will initiate the snapshot transfers
  and exit successfully without waiting for completion. Defaults to true.

- `transfer_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - How long to wait for a snapshot to be transferred to an additional region
  before timing out. The default transfer timeout is "30m" (valid time units
  include `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, and `h` for hours).

- `state_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The time to wait, as a duration string, for a
  droplet to enter a desired state (such as "active") before timing out. The
  default state timeout is "6m".

- `snapshot_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - How long to wait for an image to be published to the shared image
  gallery before timing out. The default snapshot timeout is "60m" (valid time
  units include `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, and `h` for hours).

- `droplet_name` (string) - The name assigned to the droplet. DigitalOcean
  sets the hostname of the machine to this value.

- `user_data` (string) - User data to launch with the Droplet. Packer will
  not automatically wait for a user script to finish before shutting down the
  instance this must be handled in a provisioner.

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user
  data when launching the Droplet.

- `tags` ([]string) - Tags to apply to the droplet when it is created

- `vpc_uuid` (string) - UUID of the VPC which the droplet will be created in. Before using this,
  private_networking should be enabled.

- `connect_with_private_ip` (bool) - Wheter the communicators should use private IP or not (public IP in that case).
  If the droplet is or going to be accessible only from the local network because
  it is at behind a firewall, then communicators should use the private IP
  instead of the public IP. Before using this, private_networking should be enabled.

- `ssh_key_id` (int) - The ID of an existing SSH key on the DigitalOcean account. This should be
  used in conjunction with `ssh_private_key_file`.
